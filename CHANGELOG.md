# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

The first release: from a prototype you build from source to something you install and plug in.

### Added

- **One-line install.** `install.sh` (the release asset behind the `curl | sh` line in the README) installs the helper
  into `~/.local/bin`, checks its SHA-256, registers the service and can be run again to upgrade.
- **Background service.** `managents service install|uninstall|start|stop|status`: a LaunchAgent on macOS, a systemd
  user unit on Linux, started at login and restarted if it exits; logs to `~/Library/Logs/managents.log` on macOS and
  to the journal on Linux. Plugging in a display then just works: ports are scanned every 2 s.
- **Built-in flasher.** `managents flash` writes the firmware embedded in the helper over the ESP32's ROM bootloader,
  at 460800 baud with a fallback to 115200 and an MD5 check, stopping and restarting the service around the
  transfer. No PlatformIO or esptool needed.
- **Releases.** A `v*` tag builds the helper for macOS (universal), Linux (amd64, arm64) and Windows (amd64, not
  tested), the merged firmware image, `install.sh` and checksums; the version comes from the tag, for the helper and
  the firmware. `make dist`, `dist-check`, `check-version`, `release-notes`.
- **Firmware version check.** The helper warns, in its log and in `managents devices`, when a display's firmware is
  older than the one it needs, or when the display speaks a newer protocol; development builds count as unknown.
- **Command line.** `managents` alone prints help; commands have exit codes and `-h`; `run --log-file`; `devices`
  lists every USB serial port, shows firmware versions and tells a busy port from a board that is not a display.
- **Link screens.** Connecting, Setup needed (a QR code to the README's Get started section) and Reconnecting replace
  the single waiting screen.
- **Page dots coloured by attention**: they point at errors and waiting agents on other pages.
- **Backlight dimming** (`MANAGENTS_BACKLIGHT_DIM`) when nobody needs the screen: a minute of Reconnecting, or five
  minutes with no or only idle agents. A tap wakes it.
- **Host renderer** (`make screens`): the real UI painted into `docs/screens`, with a check that strip painting
  equals a full-frame paint; CI fails when the committed images are out of date ([ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-host-renderer.md)).
- **Documentation.** A README for newcomers, `AGENTS.md` for AI coding agents, `docs/troubleshooting.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, ADRs 0009 to 0012, third-party notices.
- **Enclosure v1.1.** Bezel posts make the bezel one solid and clamp the board; the USB-C cut is centred on the
  receptacle and fits overmolds up to about 13 x 8.5 mm; an even 0.4 mm board clearance and a 0.5 mm glass gap;
  required rubber feet at the corners (tip threshold about 9.4 N instead of about 5 N); rounded corner supports with a
  0.4 mm insert lead-in; fit-test pins that reach the board, used face down; 1 mm chamfers; a speaker mount that is
  off by default; a warning when `face_angle` is not 45. Binary STLs (0.45 to 2.77 MB), `make enclosure-check` (each
  part is one solid) in CI, `make enclosure-images` for reproducible renders; `make enclosure` works on OpenSCAD 2021.01.
- CI: job timeouts, a weekly run, `govulncheck`, `shellcheck`, `go mod tidy` and sanitizer builds of the host tests;
  the `-Werror -Wshadow` build of `src/`.

### Changed

- **Frames no longer carry the working directory.** `path` is reserved and ignored; frames hold folder names,
  statuses, ages and context token counts only. Agent ids are limited to 48 bytes.
- Names are folded to ASCII (accents dropped, other characters shown as `?`), wrapped onto two lines, and shortened in
  the middle only as a last resort. Long ages read `1d 2h`. Card text is uniformly bold and the context bar is
  readable on every card colour.
- Error cards and the LED blink only during the first minute of an error.
- Detection: a Claude error counts only when it is the last main-thread message, and old errors turn idle; errors and waiting states turn idle after 2 hours; Claude's config directory follows
  `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and OpenCode's database `$XDG_DATA_HOME`; the transcript reader scans the last 256 KiB, up to
  4 MiB when it finds no token usage there; macOS processes are listed with one `sysctl` (about 3.5 ms of CPU per poll instead of 25 ms); same-folder
  cards are numbered in start order; OpenCode turn ages count from the prompt.
- Discovery probes only USB serial ports behind ESP32 bridges (CH340, CP210x, FTDI, Espressif), retries a silent
  port 10 s and 70 s later and then leaves it alone, and never delays frames to connected displays.
- The display decoder is stricter: an empty `id` or a `ctx.limit` below 1 rejects the frame; integers above 32 bits
  saturate.
- The Go toolchain is pinned (`go1.26.9`); `go test -cover` works without the covdata error.
- `make flash` stops and restarts the service around the upload.

### Fixed

- A short write to a serial port with a full output buffer is retried instead of dropping part of a frame.
- A closed device manager stays closed.
- OpenCode: errors left by a previous run are ignored; a reply of a dead run is not "working"; a store error no longer
  hides the sessions.
- Logos are drawn the same in every strip; auto-advance on boards without touch waits a full interval after a second
  page appears; a null string no longer reaches `memcpy`; the firmware reboots when its loop stalls (5 s watchdog).

### Removed

- The single "Waiting for computer" screen, `helper/init` (the hand-edited plist and unit templates the service
  replaces), `process.Table` and the `LGFX_USE_V1` defines. The firmware's hand-written version number: it comes from
  the tag now.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09 (never tagged)

The minimum viable product. It was never tagged or published as a release; its contents ship with the first release.

### Added

- Firmware for the LCDWiki 4.0" ESP32-32E display (E32R40T): protocol v1, adaptive card grid with up to nine cards
  per page and a tap anywhere to turn the page, clock, overflow badge, context bar, blinking error cards,
  "waiting for computer" screen with QR code, RGB LED status summary, flicker-free strip rendering.
- Helper (`managents`): Claude Code and OpenCode detection, ordering by activity (working first, long-idle last),
  Claude context size and limit, serial auto-discovery with handshake, hot-plug and multiple displays; `run`,
  `status`, `devices`, `demo` commands.
- Protocol v1 JSON Schemas and shared fixtures tested by both the helper and the firmware.
- 45° desk enclosure in OpenSCAD with ready-to-print STLs and a fit-test coupon.
- Documentation: architecture, protocol, hardware notes with bring-up findings, ADRs, roadmap.
- CI: helper tests on Linux, macOS and Windows; lint; firmware host tests and build; enclosure renders.
