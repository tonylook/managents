# Third-party notices

managents itself is MIT licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The helper and the display firmware are built
from the open-source components below, and their licenses ask for these notices in binary distributions.
This file ships in every release archive. The versions are those of the build this file belongs to.

## Helper

The helper is a Go program. It contains the Go standard library and runtime, which are BSD-3-Clause
licensed (Copyright The Go Authors), and these modules:

| Module | Version | License | Copyright |

`modernc.org/sqlite` carries a translation of the SQLite C library, which is in the public domain.
`modernc.org/libc` includes code from musl libc (MIT, Copyright 2005-2020 Rich Felker, et al.) and
other permissive sources, listed in its `LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.md`. The complete license file of each module
is in its source tree at the version shown.

## Display firmware

The firmware is built with PlatformIO from the sources in `firmware/`. Every release tag has its full
source in this repository, and `make firmware` rebuilds the image from it.

| Component | Version | License | Copyright |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arduino-ESP32 core | 2.0.17 | LGPL-2.1-or-later | Espressif Systems and the Arduino-ESP32 contributors |
| ESP-IDF (inside the Arduino-ESP32 libraries) | 4.4.7 | Apache-2.0 | Espressif Systems (Shanghai) |
| LovyanGFX | 1.2.30 | BSD-2-Clause | 2020 lovyan03 |
| ArduinoJson | 7.3.2 | MIT | 2014-2026 Benoit Blanchon |
| FreeSans and FreeSansBold glyphs (GNU FreeFont, as converted by Adafruit GFX) | 9, 12, 18, 24 pt | GPL-3.0-or-later with the font exception | GNU FreeFont contributors |

**Arduino-ESP32 and relinking.** The firmware image links the Arduino-ESP32 core, which is licensed
under the LGPL version 2.1 or later. The complete corresponding source of the firmware, the build
configuration (`firmware/platformio.ini`, which pins the core through `espressif32@7.1.3`) and the build
scripts are public in this repository for every release. You can modify the core or replace it with a
version of your own, rebuild the firmware with `make firmware`, and flash the result to your display.

**ESP-IDF.** The Arduino-ESP32 libraries include ESP-IDF 4.4.7 (Apache-2.0) and the components it bundles,
among them FreeRTOS (MIT) and newlib (BSD-style licenses). The Xtensa GCC 8.4.0 runtime libraries come
with the GNU GCC Runtime Library Exception.

**LovyanGFX.** Its `license.txt` bundles the notices of the code it derives from, which the firmware may
include in part: Adafruit GFX (BSD, Copyright 2012 Adafruit Industries), TFT_eSPI (FreeBSD license,
Copyright 2020 Bodmer) and Adafruit ILI9341 (MIT, written by Limor Fried and Ladyada for Adafruit
Industries; the text above its license must be included in any redistribution).

**Fonts.** The FreeSans glyph bitmaps in LovyanGFX come from GNU FreeFont through Adafruit GFX's font
converter. FreeFont is GPL-3.0-or-later with an exception that lets a document or program that only embeds
the font be distributed under other terms, so the firmware keeps its own license. FreeFont's source and
license are at https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/.

## License texts

The permissive licenses above share these standard texts. Where a module's own license file differs in
its copyright holder only, the holder is the one in the tables.
